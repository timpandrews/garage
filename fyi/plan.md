### Market
 - Large market.  It is very common for cyclist & runners to record and track their data online
 - Strava.com is the main player for activity (cycling, running, etc.) tracking.
 - Fitbit, Google, Apple, etc. other fitness trackers

### Strenghts
 - Strava has alienated some users with poor communication, price increases, and problems with keeping user data private
 - Privacy.  Don't track location data.  The default behavior is to not share any activitiy or location data.  Only share info about the activities you choose.
 - Privacy.  Don't plan on asking for or storing any PII.  Will just need username.
 - Don't silo data.  Track you activity & health data in one location.
 - Price.  Strava's premium subscription is now $12 monthly and is rummored to be going up again.
 - Not another Social Network.  Only share data if you want to.  Only share the data you choose.
 - Something new.  Strava has been the only choice in this market

### Weekness
 - Access to data & automation.  Data from Zwift, Garmin, Wahoo, etc. can be automatically imported into Strava.  Will intially require a manual data entry process.
